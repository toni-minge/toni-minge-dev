### Fashion With Artificial Intelligence
For our agency Minge+Schmidt, Yoona.ai was one of our first clients. Yoona.ai's mission is to make the fashion development process more efficient with artificial intelligence. Our task was to develop a first MVP, including branding, UI and UX.

### My Contribution to the Project
Together with the backend team of Yoona.ai I developed the first frontend application. For this it was important to develop a robust project structure and to use common frontend methods to communicate with the backend:

```js
async function createCollection(){
  try {
    const user = JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem('user'))
    var res = await axios.post(`/api-endpoint`,
      {name: name},
      {headers:
        {Authorization: "JWT " + user.access}
       })
    res.data.images = []
    dispatch({type: 'INSERT_COLLECTION', payload: res.data})
    setCollectionName('')
    toastSuccess()
    closeModal()
  } catch (err) {
    toastError()
    console.log(err)
  }
}
```
