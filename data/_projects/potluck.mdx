## Project Overview

Potluck originally started with a relatively simple WordPress / WooCommerce setup. 

As the brand grew, it became clear that the existing system limited performance, flexibility, and data transparency.

I proposed and implemented a headless Shopify architecture using Shopify Hydrogen and Remix, turning the shop from a black box into a fully controllable, scalable system.

My role: Technical concept, migration strategy, frontend development, performance optimization, and conversion-focused UX improvements.

## What Changed
- **Headless architecture:** Full control over frontend behavior, performance, and user experience  
- **Performance gains:** Faster page loads and smoother interactions compared to the previous WooCommerce setup  
- **Flexible content:** Editorial layouts and landing pages powered by Builder.io  
- **Better data visibility:** Clear access to key metrics such as conversion rate, drop-offs, and user behavior

## The Data Approach
With access to **reliable, granular data** (conversion rates, traffic sources, user flows), we shifted the focus toward continuous optimization:

- UI and UX changes driven by real usage data rather than assumptions  
- Iterative improvements instead of disruptive redesigns  
- Ongoing testing and refinement of product pages, cart, and checkout flows  

This is an ongoing collaboration, continuously improving conversion rates and scalability as the brand grows.
