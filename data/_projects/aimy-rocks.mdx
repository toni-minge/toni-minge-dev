## Events for all devices
Because we wanted to make our app as accessible as possible, we decided to develop a webapp back in 2016. As a frontend tool I chose React, which made it possible to use Aimy Rocks on desktop devices as well as on cell phones. React has been my favorite frontend library ever since.

## Corporate Identity

Johannes (my friend and co-founder) did a great job, developing a corporate identity that reflects everything our Aimy should be about: Lightness, Elegance and Safety. By the way, this was also the first time for me to implement a complete design system based on reusable components.

## Social Media

At the time, we needed an easy way to share our content on Instagram. For this, I developed a simple tool that converts the events into Insta-Stories. You just had to copy paste the image and title into the tool and then you could save the story as a jpg and use it. This was handy because at that time there was nothing like Canva.
