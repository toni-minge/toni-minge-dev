  ### I Created an NFT Project to Prove a Point

  Somehow I've been averse to the NFT hype for quite a while. For someone who studied art in the heart of leftist political Germany, it's even harder to endorse NFTs. As a programmer, however, I became technologically interested in blockchains and NFTs. A very strange symbiosis then grew out of that. A symbiosis of criticism of capitalism, art and technology.
  ### About the Project

  To briefly explain what this project is about, the easiest way is to watch this video I made:

  ### Why Starting at All?
  When the big hype about NFTs started in 2021, I quietly observed the situation to find out what was actually happening there in terms of pop culture. And I found it strange that people were spending so much money on avatars. At the same time, I noticed how Web3.0 was suddenly supposed to be a technological revolution.

  And it struck me: Why, with all the transparency and decentralization, isn't it about your own face? I did some research, and to this day I haven't come across any project that deals with this. (In general, I noticed that few projects are really artistic projects)

  I had to start because I was annoyed and interested at the same time. And also I wanted to make it happen that people can become truly immortal on the blockchain, which was in terms of technology as difficult as flying to the moon.

  ### Smart Contracts and the Future

  A good side effect of the project: I learned to write smart contracts. To this day, I think blockchains are the technology of the future and that we can make a big difference in combination with Web2.0.
