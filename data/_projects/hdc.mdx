## Project Overview

Hamburg Distilling Company runs a WooCommerce-based shop for gin, tonic, and related products.  

The project started with a fairly standard WordPress / WooCommerce setup.

My role was to evolve the shop step by step — with a strong focus on mobile UX, performance, and conversion-oriented design, while keeping the system flexible for future growth.

My role: Frontend development, UX optimization, technical enhancements, SEO-oriented content structure.

## What We Improved
- **Mobile-first UX:** Navigation, product presentation, and call-to-action placement optimized for small screens  
- **Conversion-focused UI:** Clearer information hierarchy, better product scannability, reduced friction in the buying process  
- **Performance:** Clean styling, optimized assets, and fast page loads with Core Web Vitals in mind  
- **SEO content:** Introduction of recipe pages and supporting landing pages to grow organic traffic in a targeted way

## The Data Approach
Instead of a one-time redesign, the project followed an **iterative, data-informed approach**:

- Each change started with a clear hypothesis (e.g. *“A clearer variant selection will reduce drop-offs on product pages”*)  
- Success was measured using concrete metrics such as add-to-cart rate, checkout starts, conversion rate, and scroll depth  
- Small, controlled releases enabled fast learnings without the risk of a disruptive big-bang relaunch  

This approach allowed the shop to **scale sustainably**, improving performance and conversions over time while remaining flexible.
